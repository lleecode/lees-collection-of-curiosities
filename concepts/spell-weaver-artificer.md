# Spell Weaver

Spell Weavers are artificers with a particular interest in the enchantment of delicate materials.
They weave arcane energy into fabric and control ephemeral threads to aid their rudimentary martial abilities.
Experienced Spell Weavers can infuse robes and sets of cloth with magic,
that other artificers could only apply to armor.

## Subclass Features

When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with weaver's tools.
Your magic can take the form of threads and needles which can stand-in as weaver's tools.

#### Spell Woven Armor

When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to weave magical threads into a translucent armor.

number of artificer spells you prepare.
