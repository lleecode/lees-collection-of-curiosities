*Work in Progress*

## Iteration

Theme:
- Rethink name to represent theme better: Circle of the Sun Forge
    - create lore for sun forges

Mechanics:
- Rethink if Druidic War Magic should continue to allow for 2 attacks in one turn using Booming Blade
- Rethink if Dawn Strike should be improved to work on any attack that happens as part of an action
    - would allow for booming blade with Dawn Strike
    - would allow for 2 Dawn Strikes in one turn with Booming Blade + Druidic War Magic + Sudden Dawn Strike

## Motivation

Metals are part of Nature. Human(oid)s are part of Nature.
Usage of metals shouldn't be outside of a Druids possibilities.

## Themes

- Sun, Fire, Metal
- Paladin-ish

## Ideas

### Proficiencies

- **Armor**: Heavy armor (druids of the circle of the sun will wear armor and use shields made of metal)
- **Weapons**: Martial weapons
- **Tools**: Smith's tools

## Subclass Features

### level 2

#### Living Metal

Starting at 2nd level, your connection to the metals of the Earths allows your will to flow through weapons made of them.
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one melee weapon made of metal that you are proficient with.
When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

#### Solar Form

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel your innate solar powers through your armor.
As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a solar form, rather than transforming into a beast. You must wear armor made of metal to do so.

While in your solar form, you retain your game statistics, but your body and armor forge a radiating unit, that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
The form lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, doff your armor or use this feature again.

You have a pool of *inner light*. It starts at 0 and is reset to 0 when your solar form ends.

Until the form ends, you gain access to the following actions:

**Dawn Strike (Action)**

Your weapon flashes with golden light as you make a melee attack against one creature within reach.
On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attacks normal effects and takes 1d6 extra radiant damage.
The amount of extra radiant damage dealt by Dawn Strike is added to your pool of *inner light*.

**Dusk's Respite (Bonus Action)**

The radiance of your solar form fades for a brief moment and then renews with a 10-foot radius of bright light and dim light for an additional 5 feet.
You regain hit points equal to the pool of *inner light* built up by your Dawn Strikes.
You can't do so again, until the next time you enter your solar form.

### level 6

#### Druidic War Magic

Starting at 6th level, when you use your action to cast a spell or take an action granted by a spell that you are currently concentrating on, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action until the end of your turn.

Additionally, your Dawn Strikes improve. The extra radiant damage becomes 1d8.


### level 10

#### Sudden Dawn Strike
Starting at 10th level, while you are in your solar form and make an attack as a bonus action as warranted by your Druidic War Magic feature, you can replace it with a Dawn Strike.

Additionally, your Dawn Strikes improve. The extra radiant damage becomes 1d10.

#### Sunset
Starting at 10th level, when you heal from Dusk's Respite, gain half of that amount as temporary hit points (rounded up).


### level 14

#### Sunburst

At 14th level, you gain the ability to retaliate with burning light.

The first time a creature within the area of solar form's bright light targets you with an attack on its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your druid spell save DC.
On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 radiant damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.
The amount of radiant damage dealt is added to your pool of *inner light*.

Additionally, your Dawn Strikes improve. The extra radiant damage becomes 2d6.
