## Subclass Features

### level 3

#### Vow of Fealty

Starting at 3rd level, you can bond yourself to a willing creature through a vow of fealty.
The vow must be pledged as part of a ceremony that takes at least 10 minutes.
On completion of said ceremony, the creature becomes your vow-taker.
You may only have one such bond at a time.

It´s exact nature depends on the relationship between retainer and vow-taker, and may range from comradely loyalty to absolute obedience.

The bond ends once either of the following conditions is met:
- You finish a long rest and the pledgee is dead.
- The pledgee considers the vow broken or fulfilled.
- The DM considers the vow broken.

### Display of Fealty
At 3rd level you unlock two Displays of Fealty of your choice from the list below.
You unlock one additional Display of Fealty at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.
If a Display of Fealty has a level requirement, you must be at least that level in this class to unlock it.

##### revenge (wip name)
Whenever a creature you can see targets your vow-taker with an attack or a harmful spell, you can use your reaction to mark it for revenge.
The mark lasts for one minute. You gain a bonus to damage rolls against target marked for revenge. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.
