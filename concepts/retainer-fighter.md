## Subclass Features

### level 3

#### Vow of Fealty

Starting at 3rd level, you can bond yourself to a willing creature through a vow of fealty.
The vow must be pledged as part of a ceremony that takes at least 10 minutes.
On completion of said ceremony, the creature becomes your vow-taker.
You may only have one such bond at a time.

It´s exact nature depends on the relationship between retainer and vow-taker, and may range from comradely loyalty to absolute obedience.

The bond ends once either of the following conditions is met:
- You finish a long rest and the vow-taker is dead.
- The pledgee considers the vow broken or fulfilled.
- The DM considers the vow broken.

### Display of Fealty
At 3rd level you unlock two Displays of Fealty of your choice from the list below.

Unlocking some Displays of Fealty requires that another Display of Fealty is unlocked already.
