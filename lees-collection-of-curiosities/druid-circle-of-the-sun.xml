            </p>
            <p>
                Starting at 2nd level, your connection to the metals of the Earths allows your will to flow through weapons made of them.
                Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch one melee weapon made of metal that you are proficient with.
                When you attack with that weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
                This benefit lasts until you finish a long rest.

            <p>
                At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel your innate solar powers through your armor.
                As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a solar form, rather than transforming into a beast.
                You must wear armor made of metal to do so.
            </p>
            <p class="indent"> While in your solar form, you retain your game statistics, but your body and armor forge a radiating unit, that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), are incapacitated, die, doff your armor or use this feature again. You have a pool of inner light. It starts at 0 and is reset to 0 when your solar form ends. Until the form ends, you gain access to the following actions: </p>

                    <em>Dawn Strike.</em>
                </strong> Action: Your weapon flashes with golden light as you make a melee attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attacks normal effects and takes 1d6 extra radiant damage. The amount of extra radiant damage dealt by Dawn Strike is added to your pool of inner light. </p>
